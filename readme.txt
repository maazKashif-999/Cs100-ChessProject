About the project -  We coded a chess game, with each player having 8 pawns, a king, a queen,  2 knights, 2 rooks, 2 bishops. Each user on their turn will enter the piece name and the move they want to make. The game ends after checkmate. 
Furthermore, we implemented functions to check the validity of moves entered by the user (for example knights can only move in an L shape), updating the position of the pieces, checking if the king is under check, castling, and checking if attacking pieces can capture the opponents piece. 
We made use of OOP, mainly classes(to create pieces) and inheritance (to have a common base class for all pieces) to help us implement the code more efficiently. 
We have explained in detail the functionality of each method used in the comments of the code file.
